## Execution Summary

After each task:

```text
──── Specialist Agent: 2 agents (@builder, @reviewer) · 1 skill (/plan)
```

## Hooks

| Hook | When |
|------|------|
| session-start | Session starts |
| before-plan | Before @planner creates a plan |
| after-task | Task completes |
| on-error | Error occurs |
| before-review | Before @reviewer starts |
| after-review | After @reviewer finishes |
| session-end | Session ends |

### Native Hooks (Claude Code)

| Hook | Event | What it Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Security Guard | `PreToolUse` | Blocks dangerous Bash commands |
| Auto-Dispatch | `UserPromptSubmit` | Suggests agents based on intent |
| Session Context | `SessionStart` | Injects project state |
| Auto-Format | `PostToolUse` | Formats files after Write/Edit |

Configure in `hooks/hooks.json`.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Verification Protocol

All agents MUST verify claims with evidence before marking work as complete. No "should work" — run the command, show the output, then claim success. See `/verify` skill.

### Anti-Rationalization

Key agents include rationalization tables that prevent shortcuts. If you catch yourself thinking "just this once" or "it's obvious" — stop and follow the process.

### Context Isolation

`@orchestrator` and `@executor` use fresh context per subagent. Each task gets a self-contained prompt — no accumulated context pollution.

### Anti-Sycophancy

`@reviewer` agents push back on bad code. No "LGTM" or "Looks good!". Technical evaluation with evidence, YAGNI checks on suggestions.

### Persuasion-Backed Enforcement

Discipline agents (`@tdd`, `@debugger`, `@planner`, `@executor`, `@pair`) use science-backed enforcement: Authority (IEEE, NASA, Kent Beck), Commitment (contract-based), Social Proof (industry practice).

## Quality Validation

```bash
node tests/validate-agents.mjs           # Validate all agents and skills
node tests/validate-agents.mjs --strict  # Treat warnings as errors
node tests/validate-skills-core.mjs      # Test runtime library
node tests/test-skills.mjs               # Behavioral skill tests
node tests/test-skills.mjs --verbose     # With details
```
