## Verification Protocol

All key agents verify claims with evidence before marking work complete.

```text
CLAIM: "Tests pass"
PROOF: Must show actual test output (PASS/FAIL)

CLAIM: "Build succeeds"
PROOF: Must show build command output

CLAIM: "Bug is fixed"
PROOF: Must show test that reproduces bug now passing
```

No "should work" or "probably fine". Run the command, show the output.

See the `/verify` skill for the full verification framework.

---

## Anti-Rationalization

Key agents include rationalization prevention tables:

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "It's obvious, no need to test" | Obvious to you, not to the computer. Run the test. |
| "Just this once" | "Just this once" is how every bad habit starts. |
| "It should work" | "Should" is not evidence. Prove it. |
| "I'll verify later" | Later never comes. Verify now. |

If you catch yourself thinking "just this once" — stop and follow the process.

---

## Lite Versions

All agents have lite versions using the Haiku model.

| Aspect | Full | Lite |
|--------|------|------|
| Model | Sonnet/Opus | Haiku |
| Cost | Higher | 60-80% less |
