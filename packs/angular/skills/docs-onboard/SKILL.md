Create a quick summary of a module for onboarding.

Module: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Map the structure:
```bash
find src/modules/$ARGUMENTS -type f | head -40
```

2. Summarize in quick format:

### Endpoints
List the consumed endpoints (grep in services).

### Main Components
List components and their responsibilities (1 line each).

### State
- What is in signal stores? (client state)
- What is fetched via services? (server data)

### Data Flow
```
Service (HttpClient) -> Adapter (parse) -> Component (signals + template)
```

### Points of Attention
- Anything outside the ARCHITECTURE.md pattern?
- Components > 200 lines?
- Legacy code not yet migrated? (NgModule, @Input/@Output, constructor DI)

3. Output: concise summary that a new developer can understand the module in 2 minutes.
